# Bullet-Hell-Basketball
A team based multiplayer sports game built in Unity and C#. I designed and developed the core gameplay loop and did all the art. Shipped in May 2022

- Bullet Hell Basketball is designed to be easy to pick up by anybody and lead to fierce competition quickly
- The controls are very simple: standard left and right movement, jump, and an "action button". The simple controls allow you to play with 2 people on 1 keyboard, so a quick 1v1 can break out at any moment
- The "action button" is contextual. When you have the ball, pressing it will shoot a targeted or non-targeted shot to the opponent's basket depending on whether you are in the opponent's half or your half of the court respectively.
- When you don't have a ball, pressing it does a Swipe. You can swipe players to steal the ball and knock them back, swipe powerups to activate them, and swipe the ball to perform a targeted shot from any distance called a "Swipe Shot"
- Targeted shots will automatically create a perfect arc into the basket, and display the arc to communicate that to the player
- Players always face the ball or face the opponents basket if they have the ball. Simply touching a loose ball will pick it up automatically
- Powerups randomly spawn and can create wild and chaotic moments. Bullets always shoot out from each team's side of the screen, and the losing team will have more bullets firing depending on the difference in score

I designed and developed the game's rules/logic, player movement, ball and powerup interactions, computer controlled bots, animation systems, and scalable multiplayer logic. My original pitch for the game was just 1v1, but we expanded our systems to allow up to 8 players because we thought that would add to the fun. My goal was to create immediate, fierce chaos and competition. Based on my experience playing with others and watching others play, I believe we achieved that. I also created all the art in the game, created shaders, and wrote the voice lines for the announcer (voiced by Kieran Newell).

Bullet Hell Basketball was created in 3 months by Nick Baker, Brian Kiss, Zach Selsley, and Tom Leonard and shipped in May 2022.
